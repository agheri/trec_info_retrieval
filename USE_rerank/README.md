This directory contains a modified script from the original. This script queries a list of tweeted provided by TREC (Text REtrieval Conference). This script expands on the previous by vectorizing the queries and tweets using USE (Universal Sentence Encoder). It then computes a new similarity score and reranks the results. The updated results show higher MAP (mean average precision).


Instructions: Simply run the script.py file using terminal.
